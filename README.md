# 📱 Mobile Price Range Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their features like RAM, battery power, camera, etc.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The goal is to classify mobile phones into one of four price ranges:
- 0: Low cost
- 1: Medium cost
- 2: High cost
- 3: Very high cost

This is a classification task based on the mobile's technical specifications.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

It contains features like:
- Battery power
- Bluetooth
- Clock speed
- Dual sim
- Front camera
- RAM
- 4G/3G/Wi-Fi
- Internal memory, etc.

✅ No missing values  
✅ Balanced class distribution

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Model Building

### Preprocessing:
- Feature selection
- Normalization / Scaling
- Train-test split (e.g., 80-20)

### Models Tried:
- Random Forest Classifier


✅ **Random Forest** gave the best accuracy with minimal overfitting.


## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Improved understanding of classification models
- Importance of feature scaling and selection
- Practical experience with Random Forest
- Model evaluation techniques

## 🧠 Future Work

- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Improve accuracy using hyperparameter tuning
- Add real-time prediction interface
